> I always wanted a narrator speaking about me in the third person, so pls, let me do this for me 

Igor Cantelmo is a 27 years old brazilian developer, undergrad student of Computer Science at UERJ, Rio de Janeiro. 
He loves cult movies, but sometimes, just want to see some action and trash movies just for fun. 
Ex-Indie rocker and frustrated musician, he tries to play guitar and harmonica.
As every good geek, he is passionate for games, animes and HQ's (Sandman is my most favorite)
